Tanking
===============================================================================

What talents should I use?
For most guilds you can use the basic Deep Prot talent build. However, if you’re in a hardcore guild thats pushing the limits and you’re häving problems holding aggro, you should spec into Fury Prot. If that is still not enough, you should also start dualwielding.

Impale Prot: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxzhbZcZxizoeMzVo
Fury Prot: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVVuV0xoVoxfzoe
DW Fury Prot: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVV0VxxoVoxizox

What abilities should I use?
You should use Shield Slam/Bloodthirst > Revenge > Sunder Armor. Heroic Strike if you have too much rage.

Shield Block should be used to proc Revenge and prevent you from suffering a crit or crushing blow. This is especially important to prevent you from dying if you are on low health.

Always be ready to pop survivability cooldowns like Last Stand, Shield Wall, Lifegiving Gem or Healthstone should you get close to dying.

What race should I be?
On Alliance side, choose Human to benefit from +5 weapon skill to swords and maces. 
On Horde side, choose Troll if you’re going to get Thunderfury, since Berserking is a valuable DPS cooldown to increase your threat. If you’re not getting Thunderfury, Orc is a good option due to +5 weapon skill on axes.

How to maximize my threat?
First and foremost, make sure you are fully consumabled and world buffed in raids. This is an absolute requirement for tanks and is the biggest increase to your threat.
Secondly, use the correct spec depending on your guilds needs and make sure you are not messing up your rotation.
Also stack 100 rage before every pull, so you get a head start on threat. Using DPS cooldowns should also be done on the pull, since you want to get a threat lead that your DPS wont be able to catch.
Itemization
Always look to pick DPS upgrades over tank upgrades. For example, pick Onyxia neck not the trinket and pick the Nefarian ring, not the neck. 
You should be looking to pick up strong plate DPS items like Onslaught Girdle to increase your threat output, especially if you’re dualwield tanking.

Weapons
You want to have +weapon skill on your weapons. That means as a human, you should go swords/maces, as an orc axes and as a non-human/non-orc, you should use edgemaster's or aged core leather gauntlets with daggers.

Going dagger is a smart option if you want to let your DPS get prio on swords/axes, however it forces you to use leather gloves, which lowers your armor. It's probably worth sacrificing one pair of good weapons for your main tank, so he doesn't have to go daggers.

Stat Priority
Prioritize threat, armor and stamina. Defense isn’t really needed, since you can use Shield Block to prevent crits and if you have high enough HP, you are not really in a risk of dying as long as the healers are doing their job.
You can still change your gear sets between fights, on some harder hitting bosses like Chromaggus it is reasonable to use some more defense pieces compared to easier bosses.

What does defense do?
Defense increases your block, dodge and parry chances by 0.04% and also reduces the chance of being hit and crit by 0.04%. It doesn’t reduce the chance of being hit by a crushing blow.
The defense cap is 440 defense for lvl 63 mobs.

RAGNAROS Aggro Mechanics :anger: 
===============================================================================

::: 12/11 Update :::

:fire: Wrath of Ragnaros only affects the 3 random players currently in melee range. Following the 12/11 Update it is no longer targeting the lowest GUID.
These players will receive 1000 fire damage and be sent flying a couple yards back. Melees don't have to walk away from melee range in preparation for a WoR, but instead can continue DPSing 100% of the time. 

:arrow_forward: As a warrior you can intercept back to melee every other knock. Make sure you have a good stance dance macro for that, and if you are fury/prot without Tact Mastery then anticipate the knock back by swapping to Zerk Stance a couple seconds before to have some rage available.

:arrow_forward: Upon casting WoR, Ragnaros will fully reset his threat table and your tank will have to start building threat again from scrap. As a tank, you should pool rage before WoR and be ready to taunt as soon as the reset happens before unleashing a massive burst of threat with your pooled rage. 

:arrow_forward: Since this new method is much more threat sensitive and you don't have to stack Fire Resist anymore to resist WoR, we advice ignoring the FR cap and instead using a balanced Fire Resist setup with threat in mind (150-250 FR).

===============================================================================

ONYXIA Aggro Mechanics

• Phase 1 and 3
Knock Away sends Onyxia's current target flying back a few yards and reduces their threat by -25%. https://streamable.com/jbpjk
This mechanic means that damage dealers are at a high risk of exceeding the tank's threat after a couple Knock Aways and should be ready to use an ability to drop aggro or position in front of the boss to avoid cleaving the whole raid.

:warning: Do not mistake Knock Away with Wing Buffet, another knock back ability that affects every player in a 24 yards cone in front of Onyxia but doesn't affect threat. Onyxia often uses those two skills back to back.

• Phase 2
::: 11/09 hotfix ::: Onyxia will shoot Fireballs from above to the target with the current highest threat and any player hit within the 8 yards radius explosion will see their threat fully reset, including the primary target of the fireball. This means it is pretty much impossible for the main tank of phase 1 to maintain his threat during phase 2 in a split run since several fireballs will be fired at the raid.

• Phase 3
::: 11/09 hotfix ::: Gnomish Cloaking Device does not drop combat for the user anymore and as a result does not reset their threat either. It can no longer be used as a vanish and is now useless for Onyxia.

===============================================================================

Hit Rating

When gearing for threat, your first goal is to reach your hit cap for consistency, which is 6% with 305 weapon skill. You can achieve 6% with a variety of different gear pieces.

As a tank, you should always carry multiple gear options and mix and match threat and mitigation gear based on your group's needs.

You only need as much threat gear as required to stay on top of the second person, with a good enough lead to anticipate execute phase. A massive threat lead is useless and only puts more pressure on your healers for no good reason.

===============================================================================

Rotaion 1
1. Shield bash (always on GCD)
2. Revenge
3. Sunder Armor (as many as you can before #1 and #2 CD's are over)
4. Heroic Strike (if you have a lot of range use HS)

Repeat 1-3. Keep adding sunders to raise threat.

Cleave can help build threat on multiple mobs if main target threat is sufficent. Cleave does not generate extra threat like heroic strike does. It only builds damage threat.

Abilitys that do AOE threat are Battle Shout, Demo Shout, and Thunderclap.

Warrior Tanking Guide

Vanilla tanking can be a bit confusing coming from retail since so much has changed since then, I'll try and make a guide to break down the basics of 5 man tanking for you if I can.

I will go into the mechanics of threat and abilities a bit so if you just want a quick step by step; skip to the tl;dr.


1. Defensive Stance

The stance you are in affects how much threat you deal, Battle and Berserker Stance both give your threat a x0.8 multiplyer, meaning if you do something that causes 100 raw threat, it will only cause 80 in these stances.

Defensive Stance on the other hand has a x1.3 multiplyer, so that 100 threat is now 130.

While there are some benifits to the other stances, they are usually specific to only a few situations, and more advanced techniques you would mainly need when raiding; so in general you want to ignore the other stances as they will only complicate things for little benefit (the main exception to this rule is using Mocking Blow which I will go into a bit more detail about later).


2. The Pull

As a tank you should always be the one to pull, the reasons for this are twofold:

Firstly, and most obvious, the mobs attack you first which makes them easy to group together and the damage that they do will be giving you rage right away.

Secondly, the mechanics of pulling aggro from someone are that you need to cause 10-30% (10% in melee, 30% ranged) more threat than the person at the top of the mobs hate list. If you are the first to pull then you are instantly at the top of the hate list and everyone else needs to do at least 10% more threat than you to gain aggro.

It's always best to pull with your ranged weapon if possible, this way you can always pull to a safe position and minimise the risk of other packs getting aggroed by accident.

Lastly when you have pulled the first thing you want to do is activate bloodrage, gaining rage causes threat at a rate of 5 threat per 1 rage so you are instantly putting out threat before the mobs have even reached you and you have some rage to start using your skills right away.


3. Rotations

So you have pulled the pack and hit bloodrage. Nine times out of ten the next step is to shield block, this means you will almost certainly block the first hit and in doing so let you use your most powerful threat generating ability, Revenge.

Revenge is both the most efficient threat ability you have, even including the cost of shield block, and the highest threat generating ability outside of Shield Slam. You should use Revenge on the main target, on cooldown; using shield block to proc it where necessary.

Next is Sunder Armor, this is your bread and butter threat spam skill. You generally want to put one or two Sunders on the main target after Revenge just to put you ahead of the DPS. Heroic strike shouldnt be used at all unless you are generating rage faster then you are able to spend it with Sunder, which won't be often in 5 mans.

At this point you need to start thinking about generating threat on the adds.

Contrary to popular belief, Thunderclap is actually a poor choice for AoE threat in vanilla, Battle Shout is almost always the better option.

In vanilla Battle Shout does 55 threat per person buffed (so 275 in a 5 man party), split between all mobs; compared to 130 split plus the damage caused per mob with Thunderclap. When you add in the multipliers for being in battle (0.8) or defensive (1.3) stance that changes to 375 for Battle Shout Vs 104+(damage*0.8) for Thunderclap. Thunderclap also costs 20 rage compared to Battle Shout's 10 rage so you can get two shouts to one clap.

In addition to this since Battle Shout is a buff it causes no damage so it doesn't break CC and has full threat at any range from the mobs since it is affecting your allies rather than the mobs directly, while Thunderclaps damage can break CC and only causes threat to the mobs hit by the skill.

A Battle Shout or two will build up some initial threat on all mobs, giving you time to start cycling through the adds; solidifying your threat with sunders.

So your average rotation will look something like Bloodrage>Shield Block>Revenge MT>Sunder MT> Battle Shout x1-2> Sunder adds one at a time, switching to Revenge MT whenever it's up, with extra Sunders on the main target as needed. There will be deviations depending on the situation of course, for example if you need to gather up caster mobs with Shield Bash, but this is the general order you want to go with.


4. Managing Your Group

The hardest part of tanking is generally trying to stop your group from doing stupid shit. :)

From the high damage DPS with no concept of threat management or crowd control mechanics, to the healers who think that they need to keep everyone at 100% at all times, no matter how well you play you will lose aggro to these people and it will always be your fault. Always.

Taunt is your go to skill for these situations, it works by giving you threat equal to the highest person on the monsters hate list (so if you have aggro already it does nothing in that regard) and forces the monster to attack you for a time. During that time you need to build your threat up quickly so that the mob doesnt just switch back after the taunt ends.

The temptation is to taunt as soon as you lose aggro but say a DPS gets aggro, takes some hits and you taunt it back, then your healer throws a big heal on the DPS and gains aggro instead, the cooldown on taunt will seem like an eternity at that point. You should generally save taunt for when your healer gets aggro since a dead DPS is a slower fight but a dead healer is a wipe.

If you think the healer is safe you can taunt but sometimes it is better to let a DPS take a couple of hits to help them remember that they need to manage their threat as much as you need to manage yours. :)

You also have Mocking Blow in Battle Stance if your taunt wasnt enough or was resisted, and Challenging Shout, the AoE taunt, if things are looking really grim. binding both to a key is very useful and putting Mocking Blow in the same position on your Battle Stance bar as Taunt is on your Defensive Stance bar lets muscle memory aid you when switching to Battle Stance.

As others have already mentioned, using the icons to mark targets (skull, etc.) can help greatly in keeping the group on the right target and keeping CC from being broken, so where possible you want to do this or at least try and get the group leader to do it.

Also another piece of great advice already mentioned is getting a threat meter addon as this can give you pre-warning of losing aggro, and makes you aware those in the group with poor aggro management.

There are a lot of other little points but I think this has gotten pretty huge already so I will leave it at that, I hope this helps you!


tl;dr:

    -(Almost) Always be in Defensive Stance.

    -Always be the one to pull.

    -Pull from range to a safe spot.

    -Skill order after pulling is generally Bloodrage>Shield Block>Revenge Main Target> Sunder MT x1-2> Battle Shout x1-2> then cycle through adds putting a Sunder on each, while using Revenge on MT whenever you can plus the odd Sunder.

    -Try and save taunt for pulling aggro from your healer.

    -Try and manage your group by calling targets.

    -Get a threat meter addon.
